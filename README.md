# EasyPersonalFinance
Android app for finance management. Started off as a project for university, constantly upgraded for potential future usages.

Currently working on V2 of the app. Making it better, and practicing new stuff that I learned.

Improvements in V2:
	1. Better layouts
	2. Using Realm database
	3. Cleaner code(better problem solutions, variable declarations, less clutter...)
	4. Better performance
	5. Using ViewPager2
	6. More interaction with specific entries
	7. Using a utility class to store generic methods instead of reusing them everywhere
	8. More filtering options when browsing entries
