# EasyPersonalFinance
Android app for finance management. Started off as a project for university, constantly upgraded for potential future usages.

Currently working on V2 of the app. Making it better, and practicing new stuff that I learned.

Improvements in V2: \n
	1. Better layouts \n
	2. Using Realm database \n
	3. Cleaner code(better problem solutions, variable declarations, less clutter...) \n
	4. Better performance \n
	5. Using ViewPager2 \n 
	6. More interaction with specific entries \n
	7. Using a utility class to store generic methods instead of reusing them everywhere \n
	8. More filtering options when browsing entries
