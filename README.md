# EasyPersonalFinance
Android app for finance management. Started off as a project for university, constantly upgraded for potential future usages.

Currently working on V2 of the app. Making it better, and practicing new stuff that I learned.

Improvements in V2:  
	- Better layouts  
	- Using Realm database  
	- Cleaner code(better problem solutions, variable declarations, less clutter...)  
	- Better performance  
	- Using ViewPager2  
	- More interaction with specific entries  
	- Using a utility class to store generic methods instead of reusing them everywhere  
	- More filtering options when browsing entries
